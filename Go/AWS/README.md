Overview

This repository contains an AWS Lambda function written in Go that integrates with Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) for sending notifications.

1. AWS Lambda Function

  handleRequest is the Lambda handler function that AWS Lambda will invoke.
  Replace <your-sns-topic-arn> with your actual SNS topic ARN where you want to send notifications.
  AWS SDK for Go (github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go) is used to interact with AWS services like SNS.
  lambda.Start(handleRequest) starts the Lambda function with handleRequest as the handler.
  Packages Used:

  "github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/events"
  "github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda"
  Deploy Lambda Function:

  Build the Go binary for Lambda (GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o main main.go).
  Create a deployment package (zip -r function.zip main).
  Upload the zip file (function.zip) to AWS Lambda via the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
2. Create an SNS Topic

  Navigate to SNS Dashboard:

  Go to the AWS Management Console.
  Navigate to the Simple Notification Service (SNS).
  Create a Topic:

  Click on "Create topic".
  Provide a Name and Display name for your topic.
  Optionally, add Tags for better organization (optional).
  Click "Create topic".
  Note the Topic ARN:

  After creating the topic, note down the Topic ARN. It should look like arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:topic-name.
3. Configure Lambda to Publish to SNS:

  Configure your AWS Lambda function to publish messages to this topic.
  Ensure your Lambda function has permissions to publish messages to SNS.
